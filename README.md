# :womans_hat: matching_clothes Project :shopping:
Making matching clothes finder:octocat:
Since I am a mom of 2 girls, I really like to buy them matching clothes.
In the matching clothes, they became much more adorable.
However, it is very difficult to find the matching clothes on the site.
This is why I'm doing this project!

# Site :desktop_computer:
is now at GitHub pages. The link is [here](https://tomokr.github.io/matching_clothes/)

# What I'm doing
## Scraping the site :hammer_and_pick:	
Using python/selenium, I scrape the site. The code is [here](https://github.com/tomokr/matching_clothes/blob/main/target.py).

### WIP
- now only doing one site. I'd like to try the other site.
- Can select what size we select
- scraping the image url as well

## Cleaning the data :broom:
Using python on Jupyter Notebook, I clean the data. The notebook is [here](https://github.com/tomokr/matching_clothes/blob/main/Matching_clothes_Target.ipynb).
### WIP
- Making the code into module(.py)
- Here we just pick up the same product name as the matching clothes.
However, there's a matching clothes with different names. We are going to use some method (regex and NLP?) to find the matching clothes.

## Publish :compass:
Publishing GitHub pages. The link is [here](https://tomokr.github.io/matching_clothes/)
### WIP
- Automated publication
- Web app
- Also, using Docker and virtualenv for setting up
