# :womans_hat: matching_clothes Project :shopping:
Making matching clothes finder:octocat:
Since I am a mom of 2 girls, I really like to buy them matching clothes.
In the matching clothes, they became much more adorable.
However, it is very difficult to find the matching clothes on the site.
This is why I'm doing this project!

# Site :desktop_computer:
is now at Wix blog. The link is [here](https://xo20e9.wixsite.com/website).

# What I'm doing
## Scraping the site :hammer_and_pick:	
Using python/selenium, I scrape the site.

### WIP
- now only doing one site. I'd like to try the other site.
- Can select what size we select
- scraping the image url as well

## Cleaning the data :broom:
Using python on Jupyter Notebook, I clean the data.
### WIP
- Making the code into module(.py)

## Publish :compass:
Copy and paste the data cleaned to the wix blog.
### WIP
- Automated publication
- Web app
- Also, using Docker and virtualenv for setting up
